# Getting started building on Mina Protocol

A simple overview of creating & deploying a zkApp on Mina Protocol.

## Tools

- NodeJS 16+
- [zkapp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zkapp-cli): package for creating zkApps using [SnarkyJS](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference) which is the Typescript Framework for writing zkApps on Mina Protocol
- Berkeley Testnet Alpha: where the app will be deployed to
- [Mina Block Explorer for Berkeley](https://berkeley.minaexplorer.com/)

## Installation

1. First, make sure you have a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16 or above.
    You can check the Node version by:
    ```node -v``` or ```node --version```

2. Install the zkApp package manager
    ```npm install -g zkapp-cli```

    You can check that youâ€™ve installed by running:
    ```zk â€”version```

3. *Optional* Setup a Mina wallet

    *This section is not required for the tutorial however I am adding it here because it's important to have the tools to interact with the blockchain, and that's where we need a crypto wallet.*

    I've set up [Auro](https://www.aurowallet.com/), thats a wallet for Mina Protocol. It comes as a browser extension and mobile app.

    After you add the extension to your browser, you can follow the steps to create an account. It will generate a mnemonic phrase and make sure to store this phrase safely. Once your account is created, you'll see the account information on the UI.

    ![auro-wallet-ss](https://github.com/edakturk14/zk-tutorial/blob/8a900421666274013d6aac194b5a1b66339e9074/IMAGES/mina-wallet.png)

## Create & Deploy a zkApp on Mina Protocol

1. Create a new project folder

    ```
    zk project zk-app
    ```

    ![create-zk-app](https://github.com/edakturk14/zk-tutorial/blob/13dbd5cc5df91324e39461f1745f5b15c593add5/IMAGES/create-zk-app.png)

    Here's what the project folder looks like:

    ```
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ build
    â”œâ”€â”€ keys
    â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ babel.config.cjs
    â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ jest-resolver.cjs
    â”œâ”€â”€ jest.config.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
    ```

    The src folder that contains the smart contracts for the zkApp. You'll see: Add.ts and Add.test.ts. These are the zk-smart contract and the test file.

    I have added the code and some comments to explain what's going on:

    ```
    import {
      Field, // Field is used to describe unsigned integers
      SmartContract, // class for zk app smart contracts
      state,
      State,
      method,
      DeployArgs,
      Permissions,
    } from 'snarkyjs';

    /**
     * The Add contract initializes the state variable 'num' to be a Field(1) when deployed.
     * The Add contract adds Field(2) to 'num' when the update() func is called.
     **/

    export class Add extends SmartContract {

      @state(Field) num = State<Field>(); // creates an on-chain state called num

      deploy(args: DeployArgs) { // deploy method, describes the settings
        super.deploy(args);
        this.setPermissions({
          ...Permissions.default(),
          editState: Permissions.proofOrSignature(),
        });
      }

      @method init() { // initialize the num value to Field(1) on deployment
        this.num.set(Field(1));
      }

      @method update() { // function to update the on-chain state of num variable
        const currentState = this.num.get(); // get the on-chain state
        this.num.assertEquals(currentState); // check this.num.get() is equal to the actual on-chain state
        const newState = currentState.add(2); // add 2
        newState.assertEquals(currentState.add(2));
        this.num.set(newState); // set the new on-chain state
      }
    }
    ```

2. We need to add the project configurations, run the command below to get the configuration wizard.

    ```
    zk config
    ```
    Add the details below:

    - Name: *berkeley*
    - URL: *https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql*
    - Fee: *0.1*

    ![zk-config](https://github.com/edakturk14/zk-tutorial/blob/13dbd5cc5df91324e39461f1745f5b15c593add5/IMAGES/zk-config.png)

3. Get Testnet Tokens(tMINA) by following the link on the pervious terminal. It takes a few min.

    ![testnet-tokens](https://github.com/edakturk14/zk-tutorial/blob/13dbd5cc5df91324e39461f1745f5b15c593add5/IMAGES/testnet-tokens.png)

    *Testnet tokens are required to pay for the transaction to deploy the smart contract to the blockchain.*

4. Deploy the app to the Mina Berkeley Testnet. Make sure you have your tMina in your account.

    ```
    zk deploy berkeley
    ```
    ![deploy-app](https://github.com/edakturk14/zk-tutorial/blob/13dbd5cc5df91324e39461f1745f5b15c593add5/IMAGES/deploy-app.png)

    ðŸŽ‰ Wohoo! You've deployed your smart contracts onto the Mina Berkeley Testnet.

### Testing

Jest Framework is included in the Mina zkApp CLI.
- The test file for our sample smart contract is: Add.test.ts
- Run tests with: ```npm run test``` or ```npm run testw``` (for watch mode)
- You can run npm run coverage to generate a coverage report which shows which % of your code is covered with test
- You can run your tests locally [here's](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/how-to-test-a-zkapp#creating-a-local-blockchain) more details on creating a local blockchain

* Please note: Jest just comes with the project, and you can use another test framework if you'd like to.

### Use your Smart Contract in the UI

Zkapps run on the client side; only the proof of the calculation is then sent to the blockchain. This means that it's just like a JS package you import to your front-end. Then you could create a transaction for your smart contract with snarkyjs, and to send that tx to the mina graphql endpoint.

- To use your zk-app on production, you need to publish your file to npm. Once you create an npm package, you can import it to your front-end. You can find the steps [here](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp-ui#publish-to-npm-for-production).
- Here' an [example](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/blob/main/03-deploying-to-a-live-network/src/main.ts) to show how to connect to Berkeley through a GraphQL proxy and craft a tx
